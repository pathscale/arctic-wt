#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! This is the original implementation of
//! [Arctic: a practical lock-free adaptive radix tree](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi26/presentation/ni).
//!
//! The main data structure is [`ConcurrentMap`],
//! which is a thread-safe [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) that provides
//! [lock-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Lock-freedom),
//! [linearizable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability)
//! writes (e.g., [`upsert`][ConcurrentMap::upsert], [`remove`][ConcurrentMap::remove]);
//! [wait-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Wait-freedom),
//! linearizable reads (i.e., [`get`][ConcurrentMap::get]);
//! and wait-free, **non-linearizable** scans
//! over key ranges and prefixes, in sorted order.
//!
//! This crate also includes [`SequentialMap`], which shares
//! the same underlying structure as [`ConcurrentMap`], but
//! gives up thread safety in exchange for single threaded performance
//! and a more convenient API. The borrow checker allows us to
//! safely take advantage of both APIs at runtime, via [`ConcurrentMap::as_sequential`].
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! use arctic::ConcurrentMap;
//! use arctic::Order;
//!
//! let map = ConcurrentMap::<u64, u64>::default();
//!
//! thread::scope(|scope| {
//!     let map = &map;
//!
//!     // Concurrent writers (with overlapping keys)
//!     for thread in 0..8 {
//!         scope.spawn(move || {
//!             for offset in 0..128 {
//!                 // 0..128, 64..192, ..., 448..576
//!                 map.upsert(thread * 64 + offset, thread);
//!             }
//!         });
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // Ordered iteration over ranges
//! assert!(
//!     map.range(5..=102)
//!         .entries(Order::Ascend)
//!         .map(|(key, _)| key)
//!         .eq(5..=102)
//! );
//!
//! // Ordered iteration over prefixes
//! assert!(
//!     map.prefix(&[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2])
//!         .entries(Order::Descend)
//!         .map(|(key, _)| key)
//!         .eq((512..576).rev())
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # Why use this crate?
//!
//! As far as we know (corrections welcome!), out of all map data structures that (a) are lock-free
//! and (b) support ordered scan operations, [`ConcurrentMap`] provides the highest scalability and throughput.
//! In fact, under various conditions (integer keys, skewed requests, update-heavy),
//! we even out-perform data structures without properties (a) and/or (b).
//! Our benchmarking infrastructure is in [this repository](https://github.com/nwtnni/index-bench);
//! users are encouraged to measure performance on their own workloads.
//!
//! Briefly comparing against some alternative data structures:
//!
//! - Concurrent hash maps (e.g., [DashMap](https://github.com/xacrimon/dashmap), [papaya](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/papaya))
//!   have excellent performance, but do not support scan operations.
//! - Concurrent B+-trees (e.g., [scc::TreeIndex](https://codeberg.org/wvwwvwwv/scalable-concurrent-containers))
//!   have good performance, but are typically not lock-free.
//! - Concurrent skiplists (e.g., [crossbeam_skiplist](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/tree/main/crossbeam-skiplist))
//!   have poor performance on modern hardware (low cache locality),
//!   although there are lock-free implementations.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! - 128-bit atomic support required for good performance (currently using [portable-atomic](https://github.com/taiki-e/portable-atomic) crate)
//! - SIMD acceleration is hand-written and currently restricted to AVX2
//! - Theoretically supports big-endian targets, but untested
//!
//! # Correctness
//!
//! The research paper presents sketch proofs of linearizability and lock-freedom.
//!
//! More practically, we employ property testing (via [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/))
//! to test edges, node headers, and SIMD algorithms. The `state_machine` test suite uses
//! [proptest-state-machine](https://proptest-rs.github.io/proptest/proptest/state-machine.html)
//! to ensure [`ConcurrentMap`] and [`SequentialMap`] match [BTreeMap][std::collections::BTreeMap]
//! on arbitrary sequences of operations.
//!
//! The `random` test suite inserts and removes disjoint sets of keys on each thread.
//! The `orthogonal` test suite is a WIP attempt to build a concurrent version of the
//! `state_machine` test. There is some preliminary work on writing
//! [shuttle](https://github.com/awslabs/shuttle)-based tests.
//!
//! The entire test suite can be run with `cargo test --release --features proptest,rand,validate`.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! **Public features**.
//! - `smr-hazard`, `smr-epoch`, and `smr-seize` enable their
//!   respective safe memory reclamation ([`Smr`][crate::concurrent::Smr]) backends. At least
//!   one SMR backend is required to use [`ConcurrentMap`]; by
//!   default, seize is enabled and used.
//!
//! **Development features**. These have no stability guarantees.
//!
//! - `validate` enables runtime checks of local invariants.
//! - `stat` enables runtime statistic gathering.
//! - `opt-no-*` disable optimizations for ablation measurements.
//! - `opt-membarrier` enables [`membarrier`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/membarrier.2.html)
//!   for hazard key and seize SMR backends.
//! - `rand` enables integration with [rand](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/)
//! - `shuttle` enables integration with the [shuttle](https://docs.rs/shuttle/latest/shuttle/)
//!   concurrency testing runtime.
//! - `proptest` enables integration with the [proptest](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/)
//!   property testing framework.
